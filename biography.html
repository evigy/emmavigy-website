      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        I was born in Lagny-sur-Marne, a charming town just outside of Paris, France. My early years were spent surrounded by cobblestone streets, pastries that actually melt in your mouth, and the rhythm of the French language — the only language I knew at the time. When I was four, my family made a bold leap across the Atlantic to Wisconsin, trading croissants for cheese curds in pursuit of my father’s deep-rooted love for the outdoors and his version of the American dream. It was a jarring shift — culturally, linguistically, and climatologically (bonjour snow!) — but it laid the foundation for a life shaped by resilience, curiosity, and a foot in two very different worlds. I learned English as I started school, slowly building my voice in a new language while staying tethered to my French roots at home.
      </p>
      <p>
        I spent most of my upbringing in Wisconsin, but my high school years took a turn when I was accepted to Culver Academies, a boarding school in Indiana. Those years gave me space to explore independence, meet people from all over the world, and start shaping the kind of person I wanted to become. After graduating, I took a gap year — not because I lacked ambition, but because I needed clarity. I wanted to be intentional about my next steps, to figure out what excited me, and to find a place where I could thrive. That reflection eventually led me back to Wisconsin, where I enrolled at the University of Wisconsin–Madison and pursued a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. It was there that I discovered how much I loved solving problems through code, designing meaningful digital experiences, and pushing the boundaries of what technology can do.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of the classroom, another lifelong passion galloped alongside me: polo. I played on UW Madison’s polo team and was fortunate enough to compete at Regionals held at the Virginia Polo Center. That tournament sparked an unexpected chain of events — I met the managers of a Virginia-based club who invited me to spend the summer playing there. From then on, polo became more than just a sport; it became a way of life. The last couple years of college, I found myself moving around to seize new playing opportunities, eventually landing in Aiken, South Carolina — a town known for its equestrian culture and welcoming community. It’s where I live now, continuing to balance my technical ambitions with time spent on horseback, in code, and under the open sky.
